P+Li -> Eta Into Atomic DImuonium (P+LH2???)

In https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01284480 eqs. 1-2-3-4, the lorentz-invariant cross section (ref. https://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/~thomson/partIIIparticles/handouts/Handout_1_2011.pdf) dsigma/dt is showed, then the matrix-element, to be used in TGenPhaseSpace, is given as dsigma/dt * 64 pi s * k_max^2 (ref. article, eq. 3). To take into accouunt the presence of many protons in the target nucleus matrix-element is multiplied by the integral d3p rho(p) for proton momentum, simply approximated by A^{2/3).
